# My Homepage
This is the code for my homepage (cjbrassington.com).

When I started making the page, I wanted something that was simple yet able to display a fair bit of information.
All it is is a series of slides that a js file (using mostly jquery) manages. Of course there is also css and images
included as well, but the skeleton of the page is very simple.

If you like the look of this, feel free to steal it for yourself, just give me some credit somewhere.
