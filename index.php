                Hey! You found my website.
            </p>

            <p>My name is CJ, and I'm a full stack developer who decided I should probably make a website of my own.
                I've put together what I hope is an engaging portfolio to give you an idea of what I am all about. From my
                projects, to my work experience, to my odd hobbies, I'll try to shine a little light on how I fill my days.
                This site has no particular focus. I want to display what I do professionally, while also showing a bit of my personality, and just have some fun with it.

            </p>

            <ul>
                Here is a quick overview of what you can find:
                <li>Work: A short summary of some of my job work experience, including projects worked on, and technologies used.</li>
                <li>Sandbox: A list of personal projects I've worked on recently, usually with accompanying github links.</li>
                <li>About: I'm awesome, and this is how I can further inform you about this. You can find a little bio, as well as my resume and contact info here.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Just a reminder: this site is still under construction, so do not be
                the least bit surprised when links/pages do not work.
                That being said, it will never be "finished", so go ahead and explore. If you break things, I promise I won't get mad.
                You can navigate the site with your arrow keys,
                your scroll wheel, or the menu at the top.
            </p>

                Work Experience
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a developer with most of my experience in web development. I graduated from UBC in 2013 with a
                combined major in Computer Science and Physics. I got my first (developer) job in the fall of 2013, and
                have been working as a web dev since. I am comfortable in the full stack, though the backend is where I am most
                at home.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I am familiar with C, C++, java, and python (to name a few) from my time at UBC, I have by far the most experience
                working with PHP, MySQL, and javascript. I also have worked a lot with basic html, and css. Learning new
                programing languages has never been an issue for me, and I tend to enjoy working with new languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a more detailed breakdown of my previous jobs in other slides on this page.

            <p>
                When I have the time I work on personal projects. These can vary from little 1-2 hours of tinkering with code to projects spanning several days/weeks.
                You can find links to the github repositories here, and sometimes a working version.

                like best practices and coding standards will rarely be followed, and the projects will likely never be polished, if ever finished.

                The source code for them is either lost, or far too trivial to be worth posting, but the results are interesting.

                About Me
            </p>
            <p>
                The work experience section hopefully shed some light on some of the finer details of that aspect of my life.
                This section is more about a quick guide to CJ. Besides programming, I am a big sports fan, and a bit of nerd. I will pick up
                just about any sport, though the footballs have been my favorite (American, Canadian, and Australian football that is).
                I also enjoy video games when I have the time, as well as playing board/card games poorly, yet extremely competitively.

            <p>
                I played a lot of sports in highschool, but my favorite was easily football. I was lucky enough to have the
                grades and ability to keep playing in university. To this day, the most likely place to find me on a weekend
                during football season is in front of a TV watching a game.

                Aussie Rules Football (AFL) is a ridiculous game that makes no sense. But it sure is fun to play. It is also my new
                sport of choice. While I still play lots of <span id="sports">[insert sport here]</span>, AFL is the only
                orginized/non-pickup game for me right now.

                Fighting a potentially diseased monkey for a mere water bottle is kinda stupid (even in 35 degrees and 100% humidity).
                I eventually realized the smartest thing I could do was to give it up. As much as I dislike making poor decisions,
                it is quite satisfying when I recognize something is wrong, and fix it.

                I'm guilty of taking the occasional goofy photo (as anyone who has me on facebook can attest to). I've always enjoyed
                trying out different things to see how they end up looking. This is often my approach when given free reign on a design.
                Try something new out, see how it looks, and worst case I can roll back to something more conservative.

            <p>
                A lot of my adult life has been finding the balance between "why not?" and "probably shouldn't". Putting a spider the size of my head
                onto my face was probably closer to the later. Nevertheless, it is something I live by: take some risks, but try not to do anything too stupid.
                And it has helped me do some pretty awesome things I likely never would have tried (like travel, and getting a computer science degree)!

                I love camping, but maybe not for the usual reasons. Being outside, being free, etc. are all nice.
                But the physics/astronomy side of me loves a non-light-polluted sky. I could spend hours just staring up.

                This is my 9-5 face. While I find what I do interesting, I understand that pictures of it may not be so enthralling.
                So this is me at work. Smile on my face, trying to solve problems, and somehow getting paid to do it.
