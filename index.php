                Hey! You found my website.
            </p>

            <p>My name is CJ, and I'm a full stack developer who decided I should probably make a website of my own.
                I've put together what I hope is an engaging portfolio to give you an idea of what I am all about. From my
                projects, to my work experience, to my odd hobbies, I'll try to shine a little light on how I fill my days.
                This site has no particular focus. I want to display what I do professionally, while also showing a bit of my personality, and just have some fun with it.

            </p>

            <ul>
                Here is a quick overview of what you can find:
                <li>Work: A short summary of some of my job work experience, including projects worked on, and technologies used.</li>
                <li>Sandbox: A list of personal projects I've worked on recently, usually with accompanying github links.</li>
                <li>About: I'm awesome, and this is how I can further inform you about this. You can find a little bio, as well as my resume and contact info here.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Just a reminder: this site is still under construction, so do not be
                the least bit surprised when links/pages do not work.
                That being said, it will never be "finished", so go ahead and explore. If you break things, I promise I won't get mad.
                You can navigate the site with your arrow keys,
                your scroll wheel, or the menu at the top.

                Work Experience
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a developer with most of my experience in web development. I graduated from UBC in 2013 with a
                combined major in Computer Science and Physics. I got my first (developer) job in the fall of 2013, and
                have been working as a web dev since. I am comfortable in the full stack, though the backend is where I am most
                at home.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I am familiar with C, C++, java, and python (to name a few) from my time at UBC, I have by far the most experience
                working with PHP, MySQL, and javascript. I also have worked a lot with basic html, and css. Learning new
                programing languages has never been an issue for me, and I tend to enjoy working with new languages.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0; text-align: center;">April 2014 - Feb 2015</p>
            <p>
                Sentis is a market research company, handling both the data gathering (surveys) and the data presentation (web portals).
                My role in the company is to build the portals. This is done primarily using PHP, MySQL and javascript, using Smarty framework.
                (<a href="http://sentisresearch.com/" target="_blank">sentisresearch.com</a>)

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I handle everything from the management of the data in the back end, to ensuring the portal is looking the way we want.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We work on several projects at once, with tight deadlines. This forces us to be efficient, as well as able to identify what the essentials are that need to be done.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Smaller projects are handled beginning to end by myself, while the larger ones are worked on in teams of two.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Manage and build our codebase over time, adding new features and removing old ones. Every job is a custom one, but we always build up from the current core codebase.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Being part of such a small team means that my impact is always noticeable. It also has me accustomed to more responsibilities than would have likely been placed on me at a larger company.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The work I do is mostly self motivated, self managed, and self taught.

            <p>
                Stage 3 Systems builds high availability web based software services for the international shipping industry.
                I worked on a variety of projects in QA and as a programmer focused on their Aquila vessel construction service.
                I specialized in front end javascript programming, server side PHP programming, and business intelligence (<a href="http://stage3systems.com/aquila.html" target="_blank">stage3systems.com/aquila.html</a>).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Began working as a QA Analyst to help with a backlog of work. Worked on functional and automated testing plans to verify customer acceptance and stability using Selenium/Capybara in Ruby
                </li>
                <li>
                    Moved quickly into a programming position as one of two key developers on Aquila. Tool set was Yii (PHP with MySQL) and Backbone (javascript)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Experimented with using Raspberry Pi as a suitable display driver for our data visualization kiosks we were producing for customers - research led to a decision and recommendation that this was not the right tool for the job. I was able to summarize the pros and cons and present alternatives to Management.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Worked as part of a team on the Aquila project involving a lead engineer, designer, QA, and customer support. Experienced at self organizing my time to support their priorities to deliver to the client on time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Worked extensively with GitHub, Atlassian JIRA, PHP Storm, HipChat, Slack
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enjoyed the entrepreneurial yet business minded environment of the company. Participated and contributed to strategy and planning discussions. Would like to have stayed at Stage 3 but the business did a head count reduction as part of another project scaling back. I’ve supported them closely through the transition.

                University of British Columbia
            </p>
            <p>
                When I first went to UBC, I had plans of becoming a great physicist. However, after a class scheduling mishap
                in my second term, I found myself in Computer Science 101. Having never done any coding before, I was surprised
                how easily I picked it up, and how much I enjoyed it. I eventually changed
                my major into a combined Computer Science and Physics degree, and was able to learn a great deal in both subjects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another big part of my time at UBC was playing football. I was on the varsity team for 3 years, and helped
                with film work for 1. While playing, I was able to get my grades high enough to become and Academic All-Canadian,
                which basically meant I played a varsity sport while maintaining an A average.
            </p>
            <p>
                My biggest mistake at UBC was not taking advantage their co-op program. During my time on the football team
                it was simply not an option. When I was done with football, I foolishly focused more on simply graduating, instead
                of gaining work experience to help land a job when I did graduate. Fortunately the lack of experience had
                an easy remedy (just get some experience), however I can still notice the effects early on in my career.

                The work experience section hopefully shed some light on some of the finer details of that aspect of my life.
                This section is more about a quick guide to CJ. Besides programming, I am a big sports fan, and a bit of nerd. I will pick up
                just about any sport, though the footballs have been my favorite (American, Canadian, and Australian football that is).
                I also enjoy video games when I have the time, as well as playing board/card games poorly, yet extremely competitively.

                I played a lot of sports in highschool, but my favorite was easily football. I was lucky enough to have the
                grades and ability to keep playing in university. To this day, the most likely place to find me on a weekend
                during football season is in front of a TV watching a game.

                Aussie Rules Football (AFL) is a ridiculous game that makes no sense. But it sure is fun to play. It is also my new
                sport of choice. While I still play lots of <span id="sports">[insert sport here]</span>, AFL is the only
                orginized/non-pickup game for me right now.

                Fighting a potentially diseased monkey for a mere water bottle is kinda stupid (even in 35 degrees and 100% humidity).
                I eventually realized the smartest thing I could do was to give it up. As much as I dislike making poor decisions,
                it is quite satisfying when I recognize something is wrong, and fix it.

                I'm guilty of taking the occasional goofy photo (as anyone who has me on facebook can attest to). I've always enjoyed
                trying out different things to see how they end up looking. This is often my approach when given free reign on a design.
                Try something new out, see how it looks, and worst case I can roll back to something more conservative.

                A lot of my adult life has been finding the balance between "why not?" and "probably shouldn't". Putting a spider the size of my head
                onto my face was probably closer to the later. Nevertheless, it is something I live by: take some risks, but try not to do anything too stupid.
                And it has helped me do some pretty awesome things I likely never would have tried (like travel, and getting a computer science degree)!
