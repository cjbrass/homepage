                Hey! You found my website.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hi my name is CJ, and I am a full stack developer who decided to make a website of my own to help showcase my skills.
                I have put together what I am hoping is an engaging portfolio. Here you will read about my work experience. hobbies, and personal projects.
                I want to shine a little light on how I live my life. This site has no particular focus. I want to display what I do professionally,
                while also showing a bit
                of my personality and have some fun with it.


            </p>

            <p>
                Just a reminder: this site is still under construction. I have done some testing, and feel like it is close to
                a finished product, but some small errors could still be present. So go ahead and explore.
                If you break things, I promise I won't get mad.
                You can navigate the site with your arrow keys,
                your scroll wheel, or the menu at the top.

            <p>
                As a developer, most of my experience has been in wev development. I graduated from UBC in 2013 with a
                combined major in Computer Science and Physics. I got my first (developer) job in the fall of 2013, and
                have been working as a web dev since. I am comfortable in the full stack, though the backend is where I am most
                at home.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have worked with many language throughout school and work, however the languages I have the most experience
                working with are PHP, MySQL, and javascript (as well as all the html and css that goes with it). I am a
                fast learner when it come to new languages, and often find myself enjoying learning what the new
                technologies have to offer.

                Stage 3 Systems builds high availability web based software services for the international shipping industry.
                I worked on a variety of projects in QA and as a programmer focused on their Aquila vessel construction service.
                I specialized in front end javascript programming, server side PHP programming, and business intelligence
                (<a href="http://stage3systems.com/aquila.html" target="_blank">stage3systems.com/aquila.html</a>).

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Began working as a QA Analyst to help with a backlog of work. Worked on functional and automated
                    testing plans to verify customer acceptance and stability using Selenium/Capybara in Ruby
                </li>
                <li>
                    Moved quickly into a programming position as one of two key developers on Aquila. Tool set was Yii
                    (PHP with MySQL) and Backbone (javascript)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Experimented with using Raspberry Pi as a suitable display driver for our data visualization kiosks
                    we were producing for customers - research led to a decision and recommendation that this was not
                    the right tool for the job. I was able to summarize the pros and cons and present alternatives to Management.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Worked as part of a team on the Aquila project involving a lead engineer, designer, QA, and customer
                    support. Experienced at self organizing my time to support their priorities to deliver to the client on time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Worked extensively with GitHub, Atlassian JIRA, PHP Storm, HipChat, Slack

                    Enjoyed the entrepreneurial yet business minded environment of the company. Participated and
                    contributed to strategy and planning discussions. Would like to have stayed at Stage 3 but the
                    business did a head count reduction as part of another project scaling back. I've supported them
                    closely through the transition.

                When I first went to UBC, I had plans of becoming a great physicist. However, after a class scheduling mishap
                in my second term, I found myself in Computer Science 101. Having never done any coding before, I was surprised
                how easily I picked it up, and how much I enjoyed it. I eventually changed
                my major into a combined Computer Science and Physics degree, and was able to learn a great deal in both subjects.
                I found the extra math as well as the different way of thinking from physics enhanced my abilities in computer science.

            <p>
                Another big part of my time at UBC was playing football. I was on the varsity team for three years, and helped
                as an assistant for another. While playing, I was able to get my grades high enough to become and Academic All-Canadian.
                The Academic All-Canadian is an award for varsity athletes who maintain an A average.

                The source code for them is either lost, or far too trivial to be worth posting, but the results are interesting.

                This section is a quick guide to CJ. Besides programming, I am a big sports fan, and a bit of nerd. I will pick up
                just about any sport, though the footballs have been my favorite (American, Canadian, and Australian football that is).
                I also enjoy video games when I have the time, as well as playing board/card games poorly, yet extremely competitively.

                I played a lot of sports in high school, but my favorite was easily football. I was lucky enough to have the
                grades and ability to keep playing in university. To this day, the most likely place to find me on a weekend
                during football season is in front of a TV watching a game.

                Aussie Rules Football (AFL) is a ridiculous game that makes no sense, but it sure is fun to play. It is also my new
                sport of choice. While I still play lots of <span id="sports">[insert sport here]</span>, AFL is the only
                organized/non-pickup game for me right now.

                When a potentially diseased monkey tries to steal your water bottle, the smart thing to do is give up
                the (even in 35&#176;C and 100% humidity).
                It would be great if I always did the smart thing right away, but that is not always the case.

                I eventually smartened up and admitted defeat. As much as I dislike making poor decisions,
                it is quite satisfying when I recognize something is wrong, and fix it. Times like that also help me
                empathize with people when they may not be at their best.

                I'm guilty of taking the occasional goofy photo (as anyone who has me on facebook can attest to). I've always enjoyed
                trying out different things to see how they end up looking. This is often my approach when given free reign on a design.
                Try something new out, see how it looks, and worst case I can roll back to something more conservative.

                A lot of my adult life has been finding the balance between "why not?" and "probably shouldn't". Putting a spider the size of my head
                onto my face was probably closer to the later. Nevertheless, it is something I live by: take some risks, but try not to do anything too stupid.
                It has helped me do some pretty amazing things I likely never would have tried (like travel, and getting a computer science degree)!

                I love camping, but maybe not for the usual reasons. Being outside, being free, etc. are all nice,
                but the physics and astronomy side of me loves a non-light-polluted sky. Southern sky? Northern sky?
                Doesn't matter. Just don't give me a cloudy sky and I can spend hours staring up.
